<br><p>Until I get my nut                                                                             <br\>                      
<br>Tossed and turned, lesson learned<br\>
<br><p>Until I get my nut<br\>
<br>Tossed and turned, lesson learned <br\>
<br>You was my first girlfriend<br\>
<br>Bridges burned, all across the board<br\>
<br>Destroyed, but what for?</p><br\>

<br><p>[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]<br\>
<br>When I get signed, homie, I'ma act a fool<br\>
<br>Hit the dance floor, strobe lights in the room<br\>
<br>Snatch your little secretary bitch for the homies<br\>
<br>Blue-eyed devil with a fat-ass monkey<br\>
<br>I'ma buy a brand new Caddy on vogues<br\>
<br>Chunk the hood up, two times, deuce-four<br\>
<br>Platinum on everythin', platinum on weddin' ring<br\>
<br>Married to the game and a bad bitch chose<br\>
<br>When I get signed, homie, I'ma buy a strap<br\>
<br>Straight from the CIA, set it on my lap<br\>
<br>Take a few M-16s to the hood<br\>
<br>Pass 'em all out on the block, what's good?<br\>
<br>I'ma put the Compton swap meet by the White House<br\>
<br>Republican run up, get socked out<br\>
<br>Hit the press with a Cuban link on my neck<br\>
<br>Uneducated, but I got a million-dollar check like that</p><br\>

<br><p>[Refrain: Thundercat & George Clinton]<br\>
<br>We should never gave<br\>
<br>We should never gave niggas money<br\>
<br>Go back home, money, go back home<br\>
<br>We should never gave<br\>
<br>We should never gave niggas money<br\>
<br>Go back home, money, go back home<br\>
<br>(Everybody get out)<p\><br\>
<br><br\>
<br><p>[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar, Thundercat & George Clinton]<br\>
<br>At first, I did love you (Love you)<br\>
<br>But now I just wanna fuck (I just wanna fuck)<br\>
<br>Late nights thinkin' of you (Of you)<br\>
<br>Until I get my nut ('Til I get my nut)<br\>
<br>Tossed and turned, lesson learned<br\>
<br>You was my first girlfriend<br\>
<br>Bridges burned, all across the board (Across the board)<br\>
<br>Destroyed, but what for?<p\><br\>

<br><p>Break: Dr. Dre]<br\>
<br>Yo, what's up? It's Dre<br\>
<br>Remember the first time you came out to the house?<br\>
<br>You said you wanted a spot like mine<br\>
<br>But remember, anybody can get it<br\>
<br>The hard part is keepin' it, motherfucker</p><br\>

<br><p>[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]<br\>
<br>What you want you? A house or a car?<br\>
<br>Forty acres and a mule, a piano, a guitar?<br\>
<br>Anythin', see, my name is Uncle Sam, I'm your dog<br\>
<br>Motherfucker, you can live at the mall<br\>
<br>I know your kind (That's why I'm kind)<br\>
<br>Don't have receipts (Oh, man, that's fine)<br\>
<br>Pay me later, wear those gators<br\>
<br>Cliché? Then say, "Fuck your haters"<br\>
<br>I can see the baller in you, I can see the dollar in you<br\>
<br>Little white lies, but it's no white-collar in you<br\>
<br>But it's whatever though because I'm still followin' you<br\>
<br>Because you make me live forever, baby<br\>
<br>Count it all together, baby<br\>
<br>Then hit the register and make me feel better, baby<br\>
<br>Your horoscope is a gemini, two sides<br\>
<br>So you better cop everything two times<br\>
<br>Two coupes, two chains, two C-notes<br\>
<br>Too much ain't enough, both we know<br\>
<br>Christmas, tell 'em what's on your wish list<br\>
<br>Get it all, you deserve it, Kendrick<br\>
<br>And when you hit the White House, do you<br\>
<br>But remember, you ain't pass economics in school<br\>
<br>And everything you buy, taxes will deny<br\>
<br>I'll Wesley Snipe your ass before thirty-five</p><br\>

<br><p>[Bridge: George Clinton & Kendrick Lamar]<br\>
<br>Yeah, lookin' down, it's quite a drop (It's quite a drop, drop, drop)<br\>
<br>Lookin' good when you're on top (When you're on top, you got it)<br\>
<br>You got a medal for us<br\>
<br>Leavin' metaphors metaphysically in a state of euphoria<br\>
<br>Look both ways before you cross my mind</p><br\>
<br><br\>
<br><p>[Refrain: Thundercat & George Clinton]<br\>
<br>We should never gave<br\>
<br>We should never gave niggas money<br\>
<br>Go back home, money, go back home<br\>
<br>We should never gave<br\>
<br>We should never gave niggas money<br\>
<br>Go back home, money, go back home</p><br\>

<br><p>[Outro: Anna Wise & Whitney Alford]<br\>
<br>Tax man comin', tax man comin'<br\>
<br>Tax man comin', tax man comin'<br\>
<br>Tax man comin', tax man comin'<br\>
<br>Tax man comin', tax man comin'</p><br\>

<br>                        <p>[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]<br\>
<br>                        The yam is the power that be<br\>
<br>                        You can smell it when I'm walkin' down the street<br\>
<br>                        (Oh yes, we can, oh yes, we can)<br\>
<br>                        I can dig rappin', but a rapper with a ghostwriter?<br\>
<br>                        What the fuck happened? (Oh no!)<br\>
<br>                        I swore I wouldn't tell, but most of y'all sharing bars<br\>
<br>                        Like you got the bottom bunk in a two-man cell (A two-man cell)<br\>
<br>                        Something's in the water (Something's in the water)<br\>
<br>                        And if I gotta brown-nose for some gold<br\>
<br>                        Then I'd rather be a bum than a motherfuckin' baller (Oh yeah!)</p><br\>

<br>                        I was gonna kill a couple rappers, but they did it to themselves<br\>
<br>                        Everybody's suicidal, they ain't even need my help<br\>
<br>                        This shit is elementary, I'll probably go to jail<br\>
<br>                        If I shoot at your identity and bounce to the left<br\>
<br>                        Stuck a flag in my city, everybody's screamin', "Compton!"<br\>
<br>                        I should probably run for mayor when I'm done, to be honest<br\>
<br>                        And I put that on my momma and my baby boo too<br\>
<br>                        Twenty million walkin' out the court buildin', woo-woo!<br\>

<br>                        Straight from the bottom, this the belly of the beast<br\>
<br>                        From a peasant to a prince to a motherfuckin' king (Oh yeah)</p><br\>
