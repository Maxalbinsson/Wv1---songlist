                <h2>Wesley's Theory</h2>
                    
<p>Until I get my nut
Tossed and turned, lesson learned
You was my first girlfriend
Bridges burned, all across the board
Destroyed, but what for?</p>

<p>[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
When I get signed, homie, I'ma act a fool
Hit the dance floor, strobe lights in the room
Snatch your little secretary bitch for the homies
Blue-eyed devil with a fat-ass monkey
I'ma buy a brand new Caddy on vogues
Chunk the hood up, two times, deuce-four
Platinum on everythin', platinum on weddin' ring
Married to the game and a bad bitch chose
When I get signed, homie, I'ma buy a strap
Straight from the CIA, set it on my lap
Take a few M-16s to the hood
Pass 'em all out on the block, what's good?
I'ma put the Compton swap meet by the White House
Republican run up, get socked out
Hit the press with a Cuban link on my neck
Uneducated, but I got a million-dollar check like that</p>

<p>[Refrain: Thundercat & George Clinton]
We should never gave
We should never gave niggas money
Go back home, money, go back home
We should never gave
We should never gave niggas money
Go back home, money, go back home
(Everybody get out)<p\>

<p>[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar, Thundercat & George Clinton]
At first, I did love you (Love you)
But now I just wanna fuck (I just wanna fuck)
Late nights thinkin' of you (Of you)
Until I get my nut ('Til I get my nut)
Tossed and turned, lesson learned
You was my first girlfriend
Bridges burned, all across the board (Across the board)
Destroyed, but what for?<p\>

[Break: Dr. Dre]
Yo, what's up? It's Dre
Remember the first time you came out to the house?
You said you wanted a spot like mine
But remember, anybody can get it
The hard part is keepin' it, motherfucker

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
What you want you? A house or a car?
Forty acres and a mule, a piano, a guitar?
Anythin', see, my name is Uncle Sam, I'm your dog
Motherfucker, you can live at the mall
I know your kind (That's why I'm kind)
Don't have receipts (Oh, man, that's fine)
Pay me later, wear those gators
Cliché? Then say, "Fuck your haters"
I can see the baller in you, I can see the dollar in you
Little white lies, but it's no white-collar in you
But it's whatever though because I'm still followin' you
Because you make me live forever, baby
Count it all together, baby
Then hit the register and make me feel better, baby
Your horoscope is a gemini, two sides
So you better cop everything two times
Two coupes, two chains, two C-notes
Too much ain't enough, both we know
Christmas, tell 'em what's on your wish list
Get it all, you deserve it, Kendrick
And when you hit the White House, do you
But remember, you ain't pass economics in school
And everything you buy, taxes will deny
I'll Wesley Snipe your ass before thirty-five

[Bridge: George Clinton & Kendrick Lamar]
Yeah, lookin' down, it's quite a drop (It's quite a drop, drop, drop)
Lookin' good when you're on top (When you're on top, you got it)
You got a medal for us
Leavin' metaphors metaphysically in a state of euphoria
Look both ways before you cross my mind

[Refrain: Thundercat & George Clinton]
We should never gave
We should never gave niggas money
Go back home, money, go back home
We should never gave
We should never gave niggas money
Go back home, money, go back home

[Outro: Anna Wise & Whitney Alford]
Tax man comin', tax man comin'
Tax man comin', tax man comin'
Tax man comin', tax man comin'
Tax man comin', tax man comin'
                    <h2>King kunta</h2>
                    <p>I got a bone to pick
                        I don't want you monkey-mouth motherfuckers
                        Sittin' in my throne again
                        Ayy, ayy, nigga, what's happenin'?
                        K-Dot back in the hood, nigga!
                        I'm mad (Hey mad!), but I ain't stressin'
                        True friends, one question
                        
                        <p>Chorus 1: Kendrick Lamar]
                        Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
                        Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
                        King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
                        Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
                        Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
                        Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
                        King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
                        When you got the yams—(What's the yams?)</p>
                        
                        <p>[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
                        The yam is the power that be
                        You can smell it when I'm walkin' down the street
                        (Oh yes, we can, oh yes, we can)
                        I can dig rappin', but a rapper with a ghostwriter?
                        What the fuck happened? (Oh no!)
                        I swore I wouldn't tell, but most of y'all sharing bars
                        Like you got the bottom bunk in a two-man cell (A two-man cell)
                        Something's in the water (Something's in the water)
                        And if I gotta brown-nose for some gold
                        Then I'd rather be a bum than a motherfuckin' baller (Oh yeah!)</p>
                        
                        <p>[Chorus 1: Kendrick Lamar]
                        Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
                        Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
                        King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
                        King Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
                        Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
                        Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
                        King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
                        When you got the yams—(What's the yams?)</p>
                        
                        <p>[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
                        The yam brought it out of Richard Pryor
                        Manipulated Bill Clinton with desires
                        Twenty-four-seven, three-sixty-five days times two
                        I was contemplatin' gettin' off stage
                        Just to go back to the hood, see my enemy, and say… (Oh yeah)</p>
                        
                        <p>[Chorus 1: Kendrick Lamar]
                        Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
                        Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
                        King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
                        Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
                        Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
                        Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
                        King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him</p>
                        
                        <p>[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
                        You goat-mouth mammyfucker
                        I was gonna kill a couple rappers, but they did it to themselves
                        Everybody's suicidal, they ain't even need my help
                        This shit is elementary, I'll probably go to jail
                        If I shoot at your identity and bounce to the left
                        Stuck a flag in my city, everybody's screamin', "Compton!"
                        I should probably run for mayor when I'm done, to be honest
                        And I put that on my momma and my baby boo too
                        Twenty million walkin' out the court buildin', woo-woo!
                        Aw, yeah, fuck the judge
                        I made it past twenty-five, and there I was
                        A little nappy-headed nigga with the world behind him
                        Life ain't shit but a fat vagina
                        Screamin', "Annie, are you okay? Annie, are you okay?"
                        Limo tinted with the gold plates
                        Straight from the bottom, this the belly of the beast
                        From a peasant to a prince to a motherfuckin' king (Oh yeah)</p>
                        
                       <p>[Chorus 2: Kendrick Lamar]
                        Bitch, where you when I was walkin'—*Gunshot*
                        By the time you hear the next pop
                        The funk shall be within you—*Gunshot*
                        Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
                        King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
                        King Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
                        Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
                        Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
                        King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him</p>
                        
                        <p>[Outro: Kendrick Lamar & Whitney Alford]
                        Funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk
                        We want the funk
                        We want the funk
                        Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it?
